My research agenda is to develop and use artificial intelligence techniques such as word embeddings, deep neural networks, generative models, reinforcement learning, supervised learning, debiasing, computer vision, data extraction in finance areas like regulations, gender norms and asset pricing.

Economic nowcasting aims to provide predictions that i) are consistent across spatial and temporal dimensions, ii) account for uncertainty and can be verified probabilistically, and iii) perform well on events that are rarer but critical. These characteristics are missing in commonly used deterministic nowcasting methods. Thus these models produce forecasts with higher errors at higher lead times and may not include small-scale yet important patterns. This paper overcomes these challenges by developing a novel deep generative model (DGM). The model is driven by two loss functions defined by spatial and temporal discriminators and a regularisation term. These terms guide parameter adjustment by comparing real observations with model-generated data. The first loss function ensures spatial consistency and discourages errors at higher lead times, whereas the second imposes temporal consistency and penalises jumpy predictions. The regularisation term further improves the accuracy by penalising deviations at the local level. The model architecture is based on stacked Convolutional Gated Recurrent (ConvGRU) Un

**High-Resolution Satellite Imagery, Deep Learning, and Return Predictability**<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('image')">Abstract</a> | Draft Coming Soon]</small>
<div id="image" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
The literature has shown that satellite imagery can be used to measure economic conditions. This paper extends this approach by applying convolutional neural networks on establishment-level high-resolution satellite images to predict real-time firm-level cash flows. The paper leverages recently available high-resolution satellite images made publicly available by Google and innovations in neural network architecture to extract the relevant features from the images that predict firmsâ€™ cash flows.

## Financial Regulation

**Capital Requirements, Market-Making, and Liquidity**\

<div id="capital" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
We employ a proprietary transaction-level dataset in Germany to examine how capital requirements affect the liquidity of corporate bonds. Using the 2011 European Banking Authority capital exercise that mandated certain banks to increase regulatory capital, we find that affected banks reduce their inventory holdings, pre-arrange more trades, and have smaller average trade size. While non-bank affiliated dealers increase their market-making activity, they are unable to bridge this gap - aggregate liquidity declines. Our results are stronger for banks with a higher capital shortfall, for non-investment grade bonds, and for bonds where the affected banks were the dominant market-maker.
